# Framingham-Heart-Study
In this Case Study I'm performing Exploratory Analysis & Visualization of the Framingham-Heart-Study Dataset. My main objective with this work is to understand the trends of Systolic Blood Pressure levels. The Systolic Blood Pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats

# Motivation
The Framingham Heart Study is a long term prospective study of the etiology of cardiovascular disease among a population of free living subjects in the community of Framingham, Massachusetts. The Framingham Heart Study was a landmark study in epidemiology in that it was the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and identified the concept of risk factors and their joint effects FHS Longitudinal Data Document.

# Description of the Dataset
The Framingham Heart Study dataset is an unparalleled source of information on cardiovascular health. By exploring it, scientists have the opportunity to identify patterns, risk factors and trends that can save lives. Each analysis is a step forward in the fight against heart disease, providing concrete insights to improve global health. This data set represents an invaluable opportunity to drive research that transforms the prevention and treatment of heart disease, positively impacting the lives of millions of people around the world.

The dataset is a rather small subset of possible FHS dataset, having 4240 observations and 16 variables. The variables are as follows:

* sex : the gender of the observations. The variable is a binary named “male” in the dataset.
* age : Age at the time of medical examination in years.
* education : A categorical variable of the participants education, with the levels: Some high school (1), high school/GED (2), some college/vocational school (3), college (4)
* currentSmoker: Current cigarette smoking at the time of examinations
* cigsPerDay: Number of cigarettes smoked each day
* BPmeds: Use of Anti-hypertensive medication at exam
* prevalentStroke: Prevalent Stroke (0 = free of disease)
* prevalentHyp: Prevalent Hypertensive. Subject was defined as hypertensive if treated
* diabetes: Diabetic according to criteria of first exam treated
* totChol: Total cholesterol (mg/dL)
* sysBP: Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)
* diaBP: Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
* MI: Body Mass Index, weight (kg)/height (m)^2
* heartRate: Heart rate (beats/minute)
* glucose: Blood glucose level (mg/dL)
* TenYearCHD : The 10 year risk of coronary heart disease(CHD)
